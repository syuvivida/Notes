\section{Data and simulated samples}

The analysis is performed using the proton-proton collision data at 
$\sqrt{s} = \unit{13}{\TeV}$ collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) during 2015, corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of 2.2~\fbinv. 

\MADGRAPH5 2.3.2.2~\cite{bib:MADGRAPH} is used to generate the mono Higgs 
signal predicted by the type-2 two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). In the 
\MADGRAPH generation, a vector \cPZpr\ is produced resonantly and decays 
into a Higgs boson plus a heavy pseudoscalar particle \Az; the \Az further 
decays into two DM particles. The Higgs boson remains undecayed in \MADGRAPH 
and is later decayed by 
\PYTHIA~8.205~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za,Sjostrand:2014zea}. 
For the \cPZpr\ resonance, the masses between 600--2500~\GeV are implemented, 
and the masses of the \Az and the DM particle are set to 300~\GeV and 100~\GeV,
respectively. The kinematic distributions are only affected by the 
masses and the decay widths of \cPZpr and \Az. Therefore, we use a set of 
benchmark model parameters with the coupling strength $g_z$ set to 0.8 and 
the $\tan \beta$ set to 1. 

Top quark pair events, produced via the strong interaction,
and electroweak production of single top quarks in the t- and tW-channel
are generated with the next-to-leading-order generator
\POWHEG~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd,Frixione:2007nw,Re:2010bp}.
The s-channel process of single top quark production
is generated with \textsc{amc@nlo}\~\cite{bib:MADGRAPH}.



$\W$ and $\Z$ boson productions in association with jets have been produced 
with \MADGRAPH5 v2.2.2. 
Up to four additional partons in the matrix element are included. 
The MLM matching~\cite{mlm} scheme is used to interface them with the shower 
generated with \PYTHIA.
%The $\W$ and $\Z$ boson samples are binned in $\HT$, where $\HT$ is the summed momentum of all final state partons in the matrix element.
%The matching to the parton shower with \PYTHIA is performed with the FXFX merging algorithm~\cite{Frederix:2012ps}.
%Up to two additional jets are included in the matrix element.
Diboson processes ($\W\W$, $\W\Z$ and $\Z\Z$) are generated
with \PYTHIA~8.205.

All events are generated at the center of mass 
energy of $13\TeV$ and use the NNPDF~3.0 PDF sets~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}.
The parton showering and hadronisation are performed with \PYTHIA~8.205 using 
the CUETP8M1 tune~\cite{Skands:2014pea,CMS-PAS-GEN-14-001}.
All generated samples are processed through a 
\GEANTfour-based~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} simulation of the CMS detector.
All simulated samples include the simulation of additional inelastic 
proton-proton interactions within the same bunch crossing (``in-time pileup'') 
and the simulation of additional contribution in the signal readout from the 
previous and next bunch crossing (``out-of-time pileup'')
which are assumed to be $25\,\text{ns}$ apart from the main bunch crossing.
%The resolution and efficiencies for reconstructed objects are corrected
%to match the ones measured in data.
