% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
  We present a search for the production of heavy resonances
  decaying into top-antitop quark pairs in the lepton+jets channel.
  The analysis is performed using 2.6~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected
  in proton-proton collisions at ${\sqrt{s}=13}$~TeV with the CMS detector.
  The selection is optimized for heavy resonance masses,
  where the top quarks have large Lorentz-boosts. This results
  in non-isolated leptons from the leptonic ${\W}$ decay 
  and two or more quarks reconstructed in a single jet from the 
  ${\cPqt \to \cPqb \W \to \cPqb \cPq \cPq'}$ decay.
  These jets are identified using top-tagging algorithms.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
